The goal of the first lesson is to become familiar with the computational graph. When we use TensorFlow, we set up a graph in a declarative way in Python. The framework can then convert the code to optimize for running on a desktop, server, or mobile devices using either CPU or GPU architecture. This level of abstraction allows us to focus on the structure of the machine learning model. It's a good thing, because neural networks are complicated enough as is, without having to worry about optimizing across different architectures.
