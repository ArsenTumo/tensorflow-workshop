Exercise 3: Inspect the graph (documentation).

Step 1:
Get the default graph and store it in a Python variable. Call it ‘graph’.

Step 2:
Print out the names of all the operations in the graph. Note that the TensorFlow name for an operation is different from the Python variable we pointed at it.

Step 3:
Print out each operation in full (documentation). You can use the Python built-in print command (documentation). What do the operations look like? Make sure to understand all the parts of the proto buffer that is printed out.

Step 4:
Create a new operation in the default graph and give it a TensorFlow name. Print out the operation.

Step 5:
How many operations are in the default graph? How many are in ‘graph’? Is this what you would expect? Explain why.
