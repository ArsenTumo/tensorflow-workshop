# tensorflow-workshop
An introductory workshop for machine learning using the TensorFlow framework.

## Overview
Machine learning is no longer limited to academic environments or tech companies. Rather it is becoming an essential part of a programmer's toolkit and has wide-ranging applications in fields as diverse as medical diagnoses, autonomous vehicles, computer vision, and language understanding. Even beyond these classic examples of areas where ML has proven useful, it's potential is seemingly unlimited. In any situation where there is a lot of data at hand, the principles of ML can be used to generate predictive models and, in turn, to help humans with a variety of tasks. With open-source libraries like TensorFlow, the tools that were once only available to large companies with vast resources are now at the fingertips of anyone with access to a computer.

## Goals of this workshop:
 - teach the fundamentals of machine learning
 - intuitive approach to some of the math concepts underlying machine learning
 - build computational graphs in TensorFlow
 - cover basic learning models
 - develop working knowledge of Python for TensorFlow
 - introduction to neural networks
 - get excited about machine learning and TensorFlow

## Non-goals of this workshop:
 - teach all the math behind machine learning
 - teach Python in depth
 - comprehensive coverage of various methods of machine learning
