In the second lesson, we will create a trivial example to illustrate the process of training a weight. Our model will have  a single neuron, a single feature, and we will train using a single example. Of course, this is not a practical use case, but it will illustrate the fundamentals of machine learning. In particular, we will discuss features, weights, examples, loss function, and optimization. Along the way, we will use TensorBoard to visualize both the computation graph and how training iteratively updates the feature weight to minimize loss.
